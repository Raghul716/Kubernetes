# Node Draining :
Node draining in Kubernetes is the process of safely evicting all the running Pods from a node, preparing it for maintenance, decommissioning, or upgrades. Draining a node ensures that no workloads remain on the node, and the pods are rescheduled onto other nodes in the cluster, minimizing downtime and service disruption.

Common Use Cases for Node Draining:
1.Node maintenance (e.g., upgrading the operating system or kernel).
2.Scaling down a cluster (removing nodes).
3.Decommissioning or replacing hardware

# DaemonSets: 

A DaemonSet in Kubernetes is a controller that ensures that a specific pod runs on every node in a cluster. This is useful for running background processes or services that need to be running on all nodes, such as network plugins, cluster add-ons, or system daemons.

# Uncordoning a Kubernetes Node

Uncordoning a node in Kubernetes means making it available for scheduling new pods. A cordoned node is temporarily taken out of service to prevent new pods from being scheduled on it. This is often done for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.
