Application Configuration 

Most people already understand "configuration" as settings that influence the operation of an application.
Kubernetes allows user to pass dynamic configuration values to application at Runtime.
These dynamic Configuration helps user to control the Application Flow.

Kubernetes provides several mechanisms to manage application configuration effectively. Here are the primary methods:

1. Config-Maps
2. Secrets
3. Config-Maps & Secrets.
4. Environment Variables.
5. Volume Mounts.

1. ConfigMap

Keep the Non-Sensitive Data in ConfigMap, which can be passed to Container Application.
Config Map Store Data in Key-Value format.
ConfigMaps allow you to separate your configurations from your Pods and components.
ConfigMap helps to makes configurations easier to change and manage, and prevents hardcoding configuration data to Pod specifications.

Config Map via Config File.

# kubectl create configmap [NAME] --from-file [/PATH/TO/ FILE.PROPERTIES] --from-file [/PATH/TO/FILE2.PROPERTIES]
# kubectl create configmap [NAME] --from-file [/PATH/TO/ DIRECTORY]

Get ConfigMap via CLI.

# kubectl get configmap <Config_map_name> -o yaml/json

2. Secrets
Secrets are similar to ConfigMap but designed to keep the Sensitive Data.
Purpose: Store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or certificates.
Usage:
Create a Secret with the sensitive data.
Mount the Secret as a volume in your Pod's container.
Access the sensitive data within the container using environment variables or files.

Create Secrets from file.

# kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=./username.txt â€”from-file=./password.txt
Note : Special characters such as $, \, *, and ! require escaping.


Sample Secrets YAML file 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
name: mysecret-manifest
type: Opaque
data:
username: YW5zaHVsY2hhdWhhbg==
password: VGVzdGt1VybmV0ZXMxMjM0NQ==
