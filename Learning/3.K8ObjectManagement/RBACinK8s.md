# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes

RBAC is a powerful mechanism in Kubernetes that allows you to control who can do what within your cluster. It provides a granular way to manage access to different resources and actions, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

Key Components of RBAC in Kubernetes:

# Roles: 

Define a set of permissions that can be granted to users or groups.

# RoleBindings: 

Associate roles with users or groups, granting them the specified permissions.

# ClusterRoles:  

Define cluster-wide permissions that can be applied to any namespace.

# ClusterRoleBindings: 

Associate cluster roles with users or groups.

# Subjects: 

Represent users, groups, or service accounts that can be granted permissions.
