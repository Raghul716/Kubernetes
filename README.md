➤ Auto Upgrade and RollBack : Kubernetes rolls out changes to the application or its configuration. Monitoring Application ensure that Kubernetes doesn’t kill all Instance at that time. If something goes wrong, with Kubernetes you can rollback the change.

➤ Horizontal Scaling : Kubernetes can scale up and scale downthe application as per the requirements with a simplecommand, using a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.

➤ Storage Orchestration : With Kubernetes, you can mount the storage system of your choice. You can either opt for localstorage, or choose a public cloud provider.
